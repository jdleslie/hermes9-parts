Various reproduction parts for a [Hermes 9](https://typewriterdatabase.com/Hermes.9.82.bmys) typewriter, for 3D printing.

## Foot

Replacement foot, printed in TPU (95A) with 15% infill. Gap between feet has been cleared out to give more space (and cushion) for carrying by hand.

## Spacebar Bumper

Assortment of loose-fitting bumpers, printed in TPU (95A) with 15% infill. Print total of four (two per side) in preferred size. I am using 4 mm.

## Left Carriage End

Scan of left carriage plastic cover, for future use in designing a replacement. PRs welcome!
